# BudgetApp
This web app is a project in [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview) by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. 
There are changes to Jonas's iteration of the web app that will be noted.

#### What I learned:

- JS event handling
- Reading input data
- Event delegation
- Number formatting

#### Additional Features (not from the course):

1. Added a gradient background to the app
